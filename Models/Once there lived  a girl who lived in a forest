   Once there lived  a girl who lived in a forest that nobody could find.Until one day this guy came along with his parents.He was a very adventures guy so he found the forest but did not find the girl for some reason.Whicth was really strange because the girl was right at the begging of the forest but we didn't say the guy entered at the begging of the forest.He entered at the most scaryest part of the forest were all the coyotes lived all te wolves lived all the bears lived and all scary animals like that.But he kept going and did not stop but usually a lot and when I say a lot that means a lot anyway a lot of peaple would stop.And throuh all tough nights he finally found the girl but the girl did not know who he was so she did not let him touch her whicth was really wearid because she always let people touch her all the time anyway back to the story she did not let him touch her but he did anyway and he picked her up and plased her on his horse and took her home and they both lived happily ever after.
